## Using Pytorch models
### Look into comments in code for better understanding and how to change
Run ```sh setup.sh``` to download certain specific packages </br>
Run ```python3 train.py``` to train </br>
Run ```python3 predict.py``` to make predictions </br>
Run ```python3 ensemle.py``` to train model on ensembling other models </br>

## Using Tensorflow-kears models

### The code is in form of notebooks and self-explanatory
```custom.ipnb``` - train custom model </br>
```vgg19.ipynb``` - train on vgg19 architecture
